// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisofRequirements = "This second step involves getting input from all stakeholders. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the current system and determine the cost and resources required to implement the planned improvements."
const design = "This third step starts by turning the software specifications into a design plan. All stakeholders then review this plan and provide feedback and suggestions."
const implementation = "The fourth step includes user notification and training, installation of hardware and software into the productions environment and integration into the daily processes."
const TestingandIntegration = "The fifth step involves combining and testing individual software modules as a group. It is done to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specific functional requirements."
const maintain = "The last step is the process of modifying a software product after it has been delivered to the customer. This involves software upgrades, repairs and fixes of the broken software."
